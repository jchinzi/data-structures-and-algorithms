# Reverse an Array
Given an array of numbers, reverse the array without using any built-in methods meant for that purpose.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I set up an empty array (reversedArray) and then set up a for loop iterating over every index position of the original array beginning with the last one.  For each index position I pushed the value of the original array into the new array, resulting in a revered order of the same values.
