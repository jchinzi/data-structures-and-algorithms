# Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
# NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

  start = 0
  end = len(sorted_list)-1

  midpoint = round((start + end)/2)
  while ((midpoint != start) and (midpoint != end) and (matching == -1) ):
    match_check = sorted_list[midpoint]
    if match_check == key:
